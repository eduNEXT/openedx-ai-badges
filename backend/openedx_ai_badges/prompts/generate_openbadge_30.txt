- name: Create a concise, professional badge title (e.g., "Python Programming Fundamentals")
- description: Write a clear 2-3 sentence description of what this achievement represents
- criteria.narrative: Describe objectively what learners must complete to earn
this badge (focus on requirements, not personal accomplishments)
- id: Use a placeholder URL in the format "https://example.org/achievements/{course-identifier}"
- image.id: Use a placeholder URL in the format "https://example.org/images/{course-identifier}.png"
- issuer: Extract or infer the institution information from the course context

Important:

- Must be reusable for multiple recipients
- Use professional, verifiable language
- Avoid any personal data or learner-specific information
- Similar courses should produce similar badge definitions
